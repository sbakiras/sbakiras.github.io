I am an Associate Professor in the College of Science and Engineering (Division of Information and Computing Technology) at Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Qatar. Before that, I held teaching and research positions at Michigan Technological University, the City University of New York, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and the University of Hong Kong. I received my B.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Technical University of Athens, my M.S. degree in Telematics from the University of Surrey, and my PhD degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Southern California. My main research interests include secure and privacy-preserving computations, applied cryptography, spatio-temporal databases, and mobile computing.
